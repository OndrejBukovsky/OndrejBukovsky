			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>BeagleBone® Black is a low-cost, high-expansion, community-supported development platform for developers
				and hobbyists. Users can boot Linux in under 10 seconds and get started on development in less than 5
				minutes with just a single USB cable. Like its predecessors, the BeagleBone® Black is designed to
				address the Open Source Community, early adopters, and anyone interested in a low cost ARM® Cortex™-A8
				based processor. It has been equipped with a minimum set of peripherals to allow the user to experience
				the power of the processor and also offers access to many of the interfaces and allows for the use of
				add-on boards called capes, to add many different combinations of features. A user may also develop
				their own board or add their own circuitry.</p>
			
				<p>1GHz ARM® Cortex-A8 (Texas Instruments Sitara AM3358)</p>
